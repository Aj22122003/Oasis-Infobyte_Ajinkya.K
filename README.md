Here comes my first project for Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Virtual Internship on "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Retail Sales".
In this project, I dove into a comprehensive analysis of a retail sales dataset, uncovering key patterns, trends, and insights to inform business decisions.

~Data Loading and Cleaning: I learned to prepare retail sales data for analysis by ensuring its accuracy and completeness.

~Descriptive Statistics: I gained proficiency in calculating basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand data trends and variability.

~Time Series Analysis: I developed skills in analyzing sales trends over time, identifying seasonal patterns, and detecting anomalies.

~Customer and Product Analysis: I learned to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior to target marketing efforts effectively.

~Visualization: I mastered the use of visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to communicate data insights clearly



Key takeaways:

- The power of EDA in driving business growth
- Insights into customer purchasing behavior and demographics
- Trends and patterns in retail sales data
